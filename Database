Q.1 What is a database ? Explain with an example on why should we need a database ?
Ans.  A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. Databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS) which provide tools to store,
      retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently.
    
      Why We Need a Database :-
      Databases are essential for managing large volumes of data and ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility. They support multiple users and applications, making data management 
      more efficient and reliable compared to manual or file-based systems.
      
      Example :-
      Imagine a library that tracks its collection of books. Without a database, the library would have to use physical cards or simple spreadsheets to log information about each book, 
      such as title, author, genre, and availability. This method can become unmanageable and error-prone as the number of books grows.
      With a database, the library can store all this information in a structured format. For instance:
      Table: Books
      Columns: BookID, Title, Author, Genre, Availability

Q.2 Write a short note on file base storage system .Explain the major challanges of a file -based storage system .
Ans.  File-Based Storage System :-
      A file-based storage system is a method of storing data in individual files on a computer or a network. Each file is managed independently by the operating system,
      and data is accessed through file handling procedures.
      
      Major Challenges of a File-Based Storage System :-
      Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:
      Redundancy: Duplication of data across multiple files can lead to wasted storage space.
      Inconsistency: Changes in one file may not be reflected in others, causing discrepancies.
      Data Isolation:
      Data is scattered across multiple files, making it difficult to retrieve and integrate information from different sources.
      Difficulty in Accessing Data:
      Complex queries and reporting require custom programs, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.
      Lack of Data Integrity:
      Enforcing constraints (e.g., unique identifiers, valid data ranges) is challenging, leading to potential data corruption and inaccuracies.
      Concurrency Issues:
      Multiple users accessing or modifying the same file simultaneously can cause conflicts and data corruption.
      Security Limitations:
      File-based systems often lack fine-grained access controls, making it difficult to enforce security policies and protect sensitive data.
      Scalability Problems:
      As data volume grows, managing and maintaining file-based systems becomes increasingly cumbersome and inefficient.
      Backup and Recovery Challenges:
      Ensuring consistent and comprehensive backups can be difficult, and recovering from failures may require manual intervention and substantial downtime.

Q.3 What is DBMS ? What was the need for DBMS ?
Ans-  A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that enables the creation, management, and manipulation of databases. It provides an interface for users and applications 
      to interact with the data, ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.
