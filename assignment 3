Q.1 What is HTML language?
Ans- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used to create and design web pages. HTML is used to structure content on the 
web and allows developers to define the structure of a web page using various tags and attributes. HTML is the foundation of all websites and is used to display text,
images, videos, and other multimedia content. It is a core technology for building websites and is used alongside CSS and JavaScript to create interactive and dynamic
web pages.


Q.2 What is CSS?
Ans-CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to define the visual presentation of a web page, including its layout, colors, fonts,
and other design elements. CSS allows developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content, making it easier to manage and maintain the website. 
With CSS, developers can control the visual style of a web page, create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes, and add animations and interactivity
to web pages. CSS is a critical technology for web design and development and is used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create engaging and dynamic websites.


Q.3 Why did the javacript come into the picture? 
Ans- JavaScript was created to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. Before JavaScript, web pages were mostly static and lacked the ability to 
respond to user interactions. JavaScript allowed developers to add functionality such as form validation, animations, and dynamic content updates without the need for
server-side processing. JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world and is used for both frontend and backend web development, 
as well as for developing mobile and desktop applications. It has significantly enhanced the user experience of the web and has made it possible to create interactive
and dynamic web pages that can respond to user interactions in real-time.

Q.4 History of Javascript and gcmascript.EXplain in your world?
Ans- JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. It was originally called Mocha, then changed to
LiveScript before finally being named JavaScript. Its initial purpose was to add interactive features to web pages, such as form validation and dynamic content updates. 
JavaScript quickly became popular and was adopted by other web browsers, becoming a standard technology for web development.
    In 1996, a standards organization called the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) created a committee to standardize JavaScript. This led to the 
 creation of ECMAScript, a standardized version of JavaScript that defines its syntax, semantics, and core features. The first version of ECMAScript was released
 in 1997, and it has since been updated several times, with the most recent version being ECMAScript 2021.

 ECMAScript is now the official name for the standard that JavaScript implements. It is maintained by the ECMA International organization and is designed to ensure that
 JavaScript remains a relevant and useful language for web development. ECMAScript is widely used today in frontend and backend web development, as well as for developing
 mobile and desktop applications. It continues to evolve to meet the needs of developers and to support new features and technologies in web development.
