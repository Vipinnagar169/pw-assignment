Ans-Starting with "Hello, World!" is a simple and easy way to introduce the fundamental concepts of programming and become familiar with the basic syntax and
structure of a programming language. It is a common tradition because it provides a sense of accomplishment, motivation, and confidence in learners as they begin to
write their first lines of code. Additionally, "Hello, World!" can serve as a foundation for more complex programs in the future.

Q.2 How is the use of comments and how do you write comments in HTML?
Ans- Comments in HTML are used to include notes or explanations for the code that will not be visible to the user. To write a comment in HTML, you use the syntax
'<!-- This is a comment -->', where anything between the '<!--' and '-->' tags will be treated as a comment. Using comments in HTML is helpful for providing context or
temporarily removing a section of code without deleting it entirely.

An element is defined using a tag, which consists of the opening tag, content, and closing tag. Attributes are used to provide additional information about an element
and are placed within the opening tag.


Q.4 Briefly explain what HTML entities are?

these characters on a webpage without the browser interpreting them as HTML code. They are written using an ampersand ('&'), followed by the entity name or number, and 
ending with a semicolon (';').
