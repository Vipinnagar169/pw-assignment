Q.1 Why CSS Selectors are used in HTML?
Ans- CSS selectors are used in HTML to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. This helps to control the presentation of web pages and create a 
consistent design across all pages of a website. CSS selectors make it easier to update the design of a website and are essential for creating attractive and 
professional-looking web pages.



Q.2 What are different types of Selectors in CSS?
Ans- Element selector: Targets all instances of a specific HTML element, such as <h1> or <p>.
Class selector: Targets all instances of an HTML element with a specific class attribute, such as .nav or .button.

ID selector: Targets a specific HTML element with a unique ID attribute, such as #header or #footer.

Universal selector: Targets all elements on a page, using the * character.

Attribute selector: Targets all instances of an HTML element with a specific attribute, such as [type="text"].

Pseudo-class selector: Targets an element in a specific state, such as :hover or :focus.

Pseudo-element selector: Targets a specific part of an element, such as ::before or ::after.




Q.3 How do you include external fonts and apply them?
Ans-To include external fonts and apply them to an HTML page using CSS, follow these steps:
Find a font from a reputable online source, such as Google Fonts or Font Squirrel.

Download the font files and add them to your website's directory.

In the HTML file, add a link to the font files in the head section using the "link" tag.

In the CSS file, use the "@font-face" rule to define the font family, source, and format.

Apply the font to the desired HTML element using the "font-family" property.

For example:

HTML:<head>
  <link href="path/to/font/font.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>

CSS:
     @font-face {
  font-family: "Open Sans";
  src: url("path/to/font/OpenSans-Regular.ttf") format("truetype");
}
h1 {
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
}


  This example links to an external CSS file containing the "@font-face" rule that defines the font family and source. The "h1" element is then targeted in the CSS
  file and the "font-family" property is used to apply the "Open Sans" font to it.
