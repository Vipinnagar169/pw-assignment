Form enhancements: HTML5 introduced new input types, such as date and email, and new attributes for form elements, such as placeholder text and required fields.

Local storage: HTML5 introduced the ability to store data locally on the user's device, allowing for offline use of web applications and faster page load times.

Q.2 What are sementic tags?Give a couple of examples?
Ans- Semantic tags are HTML elements that provide more meaning and context to the content of a web page. They help search engines and other automated systems better
understand the structure and meaning of the content, which can improve accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). Here are a few examples of semantic tags 
introduced in HTML5:

<header>: This tag is used to define the header section of a web page or a section within a page. It can contain logos, navigation menus, and other introductory content.
<footer>: This tag is used to define the footer section of a web page or a section within a page. It can contain copyright notices, contact information, and other
closing content.
<article>: This tag is used to define a self-contained unit of content, such as a blog post, news article, or product review.
<nav>: This tag is used to define a section of a web page that contains navigation links.
<aside>: This tag is used to define a section of a web page that contains supplementary content, such as related links or advertisements.
By using semantic tags, developers can create web pages that are easier to navigate, more accessible to all users, and more easily understood by search engines 
and other automated systems.

multiple projects.

Future-proofing: Semantic tags help to future-proof web pages by providing a standard way of defining the structure and meaning of content, which can make it easier 
to update and maintain the page over time.

Overall, semantic tags are an important tool for developers to create more accessible, organized, and easily understood web pages.
