Q.1 What is css and why use it?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation of web pages written in HTML. It separates the content of a web page from its presentation,
making it easier to style and design web pages. CSS provides a number of benefits, including improved consistency, efficiency, accessibility, and search engine 
optimization (SEO). It is an essential tool for creating attractive and professional-looking web pages.


Q.2  What are the different ways to bring CSS into an HTML file?
Ans- There are three main ways to bring CSS into an HTML file:

Inline CSS: This involves adding CSS styles directly to HTML elements using the "style" attribute. Inline CSS styles affect only the specific element they are 
applied to.

Internal CSS: This involves adding CSS styles to the head section of an HTML file using the "style" tag. Internal CSS styles affect all elements on the page and are 
defined within the same HTML file.

External CSS: This involves creating a separate CSS file with all the styles and linking it to the HTML file using the "link" tag in the head section. External CSS
styles affect all elements on the page and can be reused across multiple HTML files, making it an efficient way to maintain consistency in web design.



Q.3 What do you mean by specificity in CSS?
Ans- Specificity in CSS determines which CSS rule takes precedence when multiple rules target the same HTML element. It is calculated based on the number of ID, 
class, and tag selectors used in the CSS selector. The more specific the selector, the higher its priority in the cascade. Understanding specificity is important for
writing efficient and effective CSS.
